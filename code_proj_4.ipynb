    "\n",
    "  1. Find a codebase of this paper (the original DARTS implementation is available, and you can find a few variants), download the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "  **The dataset and codebase have already upload in the OBS of Huawei Cloud Platform, you can use it directly in the ModelArts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Run the basic code on the server, with the standard configuration of the selected paperon CIFAR10 (take the computational costs into consideration)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Finish the required task and one of the optional tasks (see the following slides) –of course, you can do more than one optional tasks if you wish (bonus points)\n",
    "  3. If you have more ideas, please specify a new task by yourself (bonus points)\n",
    "  4. Remember: integrate your results into your reading report\n",
    "  5. Date assigned: Nov. 19, 2019;    Date Due: Dec 14, 2020\n"
